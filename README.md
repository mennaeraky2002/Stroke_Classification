# Stroke_Classification
This project focuses on stroke classification using Python, machine learning, neural networks, and AI techniques. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, we aim to develop an accurate and efficient system for predicting and classifying strokes.
By applying advanced machine learning algorithms and neural network architectures, our project aims to analyze and extract valuable insights from the dataset. The goal is to train the model to accurately identify different types of strokes based on various input features, such as age, gender, hypertension, and other relevant medical parameters.

Through the power of AI and deep learning, our system will learn to recognize patterns and relationships within the data, enabling it to make informed predictions. By employing Python's robust libraries and frameworks, we will implement and fine-tune the machine learning models to achieve optimal performance and accuracy.

The project's primary objective is to develop a reliable stroke classification model that can assist medical professionals in early detection and prompt treatment. By automating the classification process, our solution aims to enhance efficiency, reduce human error, and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

In summary, our stroke classification project combines the power of Python, machine learning, neural networks, and AI to create a sophisticated system for accurately identifying and classifying strokes. By leveraging a dataset from Kaggle, we aim to develop a valuable tool that can aid medical professionals in making timely and accurate decisions for stroke diagnosis and treatment.
